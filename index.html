                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <hr>
            <p>
                The site is aimed at the "AboutMe" theme, to tell about yourself, to make a cool type.I am a certified user of the Windows 11 operating system,but it's time for Linux.
                I love VoltaStandardElectronics computers and I advise you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm 14 years old from Russia.I'm currently learning python and solving complex tasks with it, making scripts, and so on.In the future, I think I'll go to c++, 
                but it's easier said than done,compared to the lightweight syntax in python.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes I play computer games, but this rarely happens, as it is the stupidest pastime. Basically, these are minecraft, terraria, 
                buckshoot roulette (not optimized crap),portal2 and geometry dash.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is very ironic that I am the only one of the whole class who is somehow interested in programming.People seem to live according to the script, 
                for them school is like a punishment, it's better to spend another day sitting on the computer playing games than somehow trying to develop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I've been thinking about it. If life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. Make life take them back! Get angry! I don't need your damn lemons! What should I do with them? Demand a meeting with the manager responsible for life! Make life regret the day it decided to give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I am the one who will burn down your house! I'll have my engineers invent an incendiary lemon to burn down your house!
            </p>
